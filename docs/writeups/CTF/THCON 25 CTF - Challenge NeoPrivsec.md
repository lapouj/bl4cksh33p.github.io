Challenge NeoPrivsec

Intitulé du challenge:

**We saw that Gideon Morse is a keen artist and that he loves beautiful things... perhaps a bit too much. Looks like he's been into ricing his NixOS/LibreBoot/Hyprland/Astrovim/Neofetch/Btop a lot lately and we think this may help us.

**We have access to a user session on his laptop but all important files are only available to administrator.

**The -very secure- connexion info we gathered were `bud`:`bud`
